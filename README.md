## üß© Core Architecture

### üì¶ 1. **Grid Buffer**

- A 2D array (e.g. 256√ó256 cells) stored as a texture.
- Each pixel encodes a cell state (0‚Äì255) using color channels (e.g., RED = cell type).

### üß† 2. **Fragment Shader = Your Rule Engine**

- You write a **GLSL shader** that reads from the grid texture.
- For each pixel (cell), it:
    - Samples the 8 neighbors
    - Applies your **urban growth rules**
    - Outputs the new state

### üé® 3. **Rendering**

- Render the grid back to the canvas using a colormap:
    - 0 = empty ‚Üí gray
    - 1 = residential ‚Üí green
    - 2 = commercial ‚Üí blue
    - etc.

### üß≠ 4. **Controls / UI**

- Add sliders for:
    - Growth aggressiveness
    - Initial seed population
    - Cell type toggles
    - Speed of simulation

## üöÄ Your Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Set up a basic webpage with a `<canvas>` element.
2. ‚úÖ Use WebGL to render a 2D grid (e.g., 256x256).
3. ‚úÖ Write a fragment shader to encode urban growth rules.
4. ‚úÖ Render the simulation output to the canvas each frame.
5. üîÅ Add interactivity and visualization polish.

Hybrid Approach for Urban Pulse
For your GPU-accelerated urban growth web app, you could combine these approaches:

Use CNNs to analyze existing urban patterns and generate baseline predictions
Apply RL to optimize urban development strategies by maximizing desired outcomes
Visualize alternatives by running multiple RL simulations with different reward priorities - Use GPU Programming for this.

## Deep Reinforcement Learning for Urban Planning
Reinforcement learning treats urban planning as a decision-making process with long-term rewards:
Practical Applications

### Optimizing Zoning & Land Use

RL agent proposes zoning changes to maximize objectives
Rewards based on metrics like transit access, walkability, economic activity


### Transportation Network Design

Optimize road networks, public transit routes
Balance congestion, accessibility, and construction costs


### Sustainable Development

Reward reductions in carbon emissions, increased green space
Optimize resource distribution and energy efficiency

This approach would be highly computationally intensive, making your GPU acceleration crucial for real-time interaction and visualization in the web app.
